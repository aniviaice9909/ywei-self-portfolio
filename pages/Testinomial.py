Welcome to my mini world! Here I would show what I've done and what I'm doing right now. I am an optimistic person, who loves to watch anime, travel, adventure and also taking challenges. I'm a biomedical engineering student, passionate and proficient in bionic, biocomputing, artificial intelligence, biomechanics, python and C++, and also make games with Unreal Engine and Unity.
